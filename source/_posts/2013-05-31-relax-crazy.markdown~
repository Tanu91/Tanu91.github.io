 You should be comfortable running shell commands and familiar with the basics of GIT.
GIT is a distributed Version Control System(VCS). This allows non-linear development of projects and can handle large amount of data effectively by storing it on Local Server.

Step 1: Install Git
	
	{% codeblock %}
	$sudo apt-get insatll git
	{% endcodeblock %}
	
	  sudo-  for administrative previlages.
	 apt-get - Package Installer, puts stuff from repositries and install them 
	
	 Now it's time to configure your settings. To do this you need to open an app called Terminal.

	* USERNAME
	    First you need to tell git your name, so that it can properly label the commits you make.
	
	{% codeblock %}
	$git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
	# Sets the default name for git to use when you commit
	{% endcodeblock %}
	
	* E-Mail
	   Git saves your email address into the commits you make. We use the email address to associate your commits with your GitHub account.
	{% codeblock %}
	$git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
	# Sets the default email for git to use when you commit
	{% endcodeblock %}

	* To see all settings
	
	{% codeblock %}
	$git config --list
	{% endcodeblock %}
	
Step 2: Install RVM

	
	RVM is Ruby Version Manager. It allows us to install and manage different versions and implementations of ruby on one computer including ability to manage different sets of Ruby gems on each.Thus, allowing to test our application with different versions of ruby setups.
	
	Run the following command from your terminal.Be sure to follow any subsequent instructions as guided by the installation process.

	{% codeblock %}
	$curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
	{% endcodeblock %}

	The above command will install both RVM and the latest version of Ruby.
	curl is a client to get document/file or send to server using any of supported protocols.

	If the above command produces an error, run following command from ypur terminal to achieve the same.
	
	{% codeblock %}
	$wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/joshfng/railsready/master/railsready.sh && bash railsready.sh
	{% endcodeblock %}

Step 3: Install Ruby 1.9.3	
	
	{% codeblock %}
	rvm install 1.9.3
	rvm use 1.9.3
	rvm rubygems latest
	{% endcodeblock %}

	Gems contain package information along with files to install.
	RubyGems. It is a package manager which became part of the standard library in Ruby 1.9. It allows developers to search, install and build gems, among other features. All of this is done by using the gem command-line utility.

	* Run ruby --version to be sure you’re using Ruby 1.9.3. If you’re having trouble, run the following command on your terminal to set your default version of ruby-1.9.3

	{% codeblock %}
	$rvm --default use ruby-1.9.3-p429
	{% endcodeblock %}
